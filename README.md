# MuseDash HardMode Script  

Hello! I'm **MiddayAxis**, the developer of this script — which you might have received if I decide to make this repository public.

I was introduced to *Muse Dash* by a friend (she who must not be named 👀) and quickly found the game pretty easy once I got the hang of it.  
So, to spice things up — and challenge both her and myself — I created this script to make the game **more difficult**, while still maintaining the original difficulty of whatever level you're playing.

## 🎮 What Does the Script Do?

In short, you'll experience a new way to play *Muse Dash* — one I call **MuSe-R**  
> **MuSe-R** stands for **Muse Rotate**  

While playing, your usual keybinds will behave differently. Specifically, when you press one key in a pair, the other key becomes *temporarily* required before you can use the first one again.

For example, if you bind "UP" to **W + D**:
- Press **W**, and your next "UP" input must be **D**.
- After pressing **D**, you'll need to use **W** again — and so on.

This creates a rhythmic key rotation — hence the name: **MuSe-R**.

Currently, you are required to use **W + D** and **UP + LEFT**, with no difficulty adjustment in place.

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Install AutoHotkey v1.1** from the official website:  
   👉 [https://www.autohotkey.com/download/1.1/](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/1.1/)
2. Download the script (`.ahk`) or `.zip` file from this repository (preferably the newest one).
3. Either:
   - Run the `MuseDashHardMode.ahk` file directly *(requires AHK installed)*  
   **or**
   - Run the `MuseDashHardMode.exe` if included *(no AHK required)*.
4. Launch *Muse Dash* and prepare for the challenge. 🙂

> 📝 Customization options will be added in the future — for now, keybinds are fixed.

## 🛠️ Work in Progress

More features, options, and chaos are coming soon™.  
Stay tuned — or don’t. I’ll probably do it anyway.
